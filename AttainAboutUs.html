                    I am a high school student who searched and searched for the perfect planner throughout highschool. Every planner seemed to either have not enough space to write down my full to-do list, or had aspects that didn't completely pertain to the life of a high school student. In attempts to change this, my team and I designed this website to help you navigate your student life, by providing a aesthetic and useful one-stop for all your planning endeavors.

							Hi! I’m Preeti, a 16 year-old who aspires to be more organized. So, motivated by the idea of helping others who also aspire to be more organized, our group came together to create Attain– The website that helps students like us. By having everything in one place, Attain is the convenient study tool.

<p> Likes: Dark Chocolate (especially Ghirardelli Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel), hiking, reading, pretty cafes, good coffee, and skylines at night. </p>

<p>Dislikes: fruits (yes, I don’t particularly enjoy eating  fruits), neon yellow, and celery.</p>

				                      My name is Jessie. I enjoy working in my own space, and listening to music, which is exactly how I was coding this website. Often I will just have my headphones in when I am alone, so don't be afraid to interupt me; I won't bite! I think this website is perfect for students who not onlystuggle to keep focus on their studies, but also students who just want a studying tool that is both efficient and aesthetic. Whether you are looking for amazing templates for bullet journaling, or planning, or even music playlist suggestions, this is your one stop website.

											<p class="blub"> My name is Natalia, I am obsessed with the nightlife, coffee and music. My group and I created this website to help people untangle their life
													but most importantly, live a healthy lifestyle. I understand the hardships of a Student, I am 16 years old and felt the pressures of always trying to be
													successful and also making it look well organized. That is why I am so glad that you are using this website. I hope this helps!

                      Multiple notebooks might seem inconvenient because of the all the weight but, maintaining an untangled life requires focus.
                  The style of the notebook also matters. I suggest a notebook that has the most simplistic design, then you will have more freedom with decorating.
                 Decorating improves my mood and motivates me to be focused. Dotted instead of lined notebooks are excellent for people who are trying to improve their handwriting.
                  Pick what is best for you! For instance, spiral notebooks that have the rings at the top, will be more comfortable for lefties out there!
                  Organizing topics and subjects will improve your focus while studying or reviewing.
                  This will also be in handy when you buy stickers, dividers and pens that coordinate with each subject. Which leads us to our next tip, writing utensils! </p>

											<p> My name is Natalia, I am obsessed with the nightlife, coffee and music. My group and I created this website to help people untangle their life
													but most importantly, live a healthy lifestyle. I understand the hardships of a Student, I am 16 years old and felt the pressures of always trying to be
													successful and also making it look well organized. That is why I am so glad that you are using this website. I hope this helps!

What’s in my pencil case? We Definitely Recommend these


Preeti:
Pens:
Black Pentel EnerGel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm
Muji Gel-Ink Black Pen, 0.38mm
Muji Gel-Ink Dark Blue Pen, 0.5mm
Blue Pilot Juice Pen, 0.5mm
Paper-Mate InkJoy Red Pen, 0.7mm
Purple Pentel EnerGel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm
Pink Pentel Energel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm
Green Pentel Energel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm

So these pens have lasted for 2 years now! The EnerGel ones don’t smudge when you use a highlighter, and none of the pens bleed. 

Pencils and Erasers:
Mono Graph Pencil, 0.5mm
Mono Mini-Eraser
Dixon Ticonderoga, #2, HB

The Mono Graph pencil is good, but it doesn’t have much of a grip, so if your hands get slippery when you write, that one isn’t that great for you. 

Highlighters:
Zebra Mildliners 
Colors: Purple, Green, Orange, Yellow, Light Pink, Light Grey, Light Blue, Dark Blue

I don’t really use colored pens anymore. I just write all my notes with a black pen and then I use different colored highlighters. It’s a really good system which makes my notes easy to read, and organized.

Additional Stuff:
Muji White-Out Tape
Mini Staedtler Ruler

        <h5> GET SEPARATE NOTEBOOKS FOR EACH SUBJECT </h5>
                <p>
                      Multiple notebooks might seem inconvenient because of the all the weight but, maintaining an untangled life requires focus.
                  The style of the notebook also matters. I suggest a notebook that has the most simplistic design, then you will have more freedom with decorating.
                 Decorating improves my mood and motivates me to be focused. Dotted instead of lined notebooks are excellent for people who are trying to improve their handwriting.
                  Pick what is best for you! For instance, spiral notebooks that have the rings at the top, will be more comfortable for lefties out there!
                  Organizing topics and subjects will improve your focus while studying or reviewing.
                  This will also be in handy when you buy stickers, dividers and pens that coordinate with each subject. Which leads us to our next tip, writing utensils! </p>

        <h5> GET SEPARATE NOTEBOOKS FOR EACH SUBJECT </h5>
                <p>
                      Multiple notebooks might seem inconvenient because of the all the weight but, maintaining an untangled life requires focus.
                  The style of the notebook also matters. I suggest a notebook that has the most simplistic design, then you will have more freedom with decorating.
                 Decorating improves my mood and motivates me to be focused. Dotted instead of lined notebooks are excellent for people who are trying to improve their handwriting.
                  Pick what is best for you! For instance, spiral notebooks that have the rings at the top, will be more comfortable for lefties out there!
                  Organizing topics and subjects will improve your focus while studying or reviewing.
                  This will also be in handy when you buy stickers, dividers and pens that coordinate with each subject. Which leads us to our next tip, writing utensils! </p>

                        <h5> WHAT IS IN MY PENCIL CASE? </h5>
                        <p> We Definitely Recommend these


                        Preeti:
Pens:
Black Pentel EnerGel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm
Muji Gel-Ink Black Pen, 0.38mm
Muji Gel-Ink Dark Blue Pen, 0.5mm
Blue Pilot Juice Pen, 0.5mm
Paper-Mate InkJoy Red Pen, 0.7mm
Purple Pentel EnerGel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm
Pink Pentel Energel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm
Green Pentel Energel, Needle-tip, 0.5mm </p>

<p>So these pens have lasted for 2 years now! The EnerGel ones don’t smudge when you use a highlighter, and none of the pens bleed.</p>
<p>
Pencils and Erasers:
Mono Graph Pencil, 0.5mm
Mono Mini-Eraser
Dixon Ticonderoga, #2, HB</p>

<p>The Mono Graph pencil is good, but it doesn't have much of a grip, so if your hands get slippery when you write, that one isn't that great for you.</p>
<p>
Highlighters:
Zebra Mildliners
Colors: Purple, Green, Orange, Yellow, Light Pink, Light Grey, Light Blue, Dark Blue</p>

<p>I don't really use colored pens anymore. I just write all my notes with a black pen and then I use different colored highlighters. It's a really good system which makes my notes easy to read, and organized.</p>

<p>Additional Stuff:
Muji White-Out Tape
Mini Staedtler Ruler</p>

    <h5> DESIGNATED STUDY AREA </h5>
    <p>
      Clutter happens. Our desks get messy, especially when you’re cramming and all our papers, books, pens, and more are scattered all over.

But a clean workspace helps more than you can imagine. When you start, make sure everything on your desk relates to the work you're doing. Put away unwanted materials so you can concentrate on the task at hand.
